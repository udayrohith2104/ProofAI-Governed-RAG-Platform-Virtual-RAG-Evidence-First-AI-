# 🛡️ ProofAI — Governed RAG Platform (Evidence-First AI)

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://proofai-evidence-first-intelligence-633639606830.us-west1.run.app  
📍 **Deployment:** EU-sovereign (Cloud Run)  
👤 **Author:** Uday Rohith Reddy Yeruva  

ProofAI is a governed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform built for **evidence-first AI** in enterprise and regulated environments.  
Unlike typical RAG chatbots, ProofAI enforces **policy-aware retrieval, auditability, grounding, and sovereign deployment**.

## 🚀 What Makes ProofAI Different

Most RAG systems optimize for answer quality.  
**ProofAI optimizes for trust, governance, and compliance.**

✔ Evidence-first responses with citations  
✔ Policy-aware retrieval (tenant, region, classification)  
✔ Guardrails for grounding, safety, and PII  
✔ Full audit logs + trace IDs  
✔ EU-sovereign deployment pattern  
✔ Designed for regulated enterprises (fintech, compliance, consulting)

## 🧠 High-Level Architecture (Conceptual)

Client / UI  
→ Secure Gateway (TLS 1.3)  
→ Evidence Vault (classified assets)  
→ Governed Retrieval Layer  
→ Reranking + Context Builder  
→ LLM Runtime (Gemini adapter)  
→ Guardrails (grounding + safety)  
→ Answer + Citations + Audit Log  

This ensures:
- Data residency  
- Classification filters  
- Policy compliance  
- End-to-end traceability

## 🧪 Demo Capabilities

- Trust Center (TLS 1.3, audit pass indicators)  
- Evidence Vault with document classification  
- Strategic Canvas (Discovery → Interpretation → Implementation → Deployment)  
- EU-sovereign instance monitoring  
- Governed RAG responses with grounding and citations  

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**LLM:** Gemini (adapter-based runtime)  
**Backend:** Python (FastAPI)  
**RAG Orchestration:** LangChain / LangGraph (conceptual design)  
**Infra:** GCP (Cloud Run)  
**Security:** TLS 1.3, policy gates  
**UI:** Enterprise dashboard (React-style)
